Loading and pre-processing the activity monitoring date.

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")

activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
# converting date from factors to date
activityData$date <- as.Date(activityData$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```

plot for total number of steps per day
```{r}
# ignoring the data with NAs
completeData <- activityData[!is.na(activityData$steps), ]

aggByDate <- aggregate(completeData$steps, by = list(completeData$date), FUN = sum)
colnames(aggByDate) <- c("date", "totalSteps")

# plot a bar plot not sure why questions refers to a histogram
barplot(aggByDate$totalSteps, names.arg = aggByDate$date, ylab = "total steps")

# mean
meanSteps <- mean(aggByDate$totalSteps)

# order the data for finding the mean.
orderedData <- aggByDate[order(aggByDate$totalSteps),]
medianSteps <- median(orderedData$totalSteps)

```
The mean number of steps taken per day are `r meanSteps`.
The median number of steps are `r medianSteps`.
